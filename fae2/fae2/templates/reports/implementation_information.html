   <p><strong>Note:</strong> Future versions of FAE will allow you to mark manual checks as, pass, fail or not applicable.</p>

  <h2>Implementation Score Computation</h2>

  <p>Implementation Score = P / (P + F + MC)</p>

  <p>Each variable represents the number of element level results for a particular rule, where:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>P = elements that passed</li>
      <li>F = elements that failed</li>
      <li>MC = elements that require a manual check</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The score ranges in value from 0 to 100, that is from no implementation to all accessibility requirements met. In the future, FAE will allow you to change manual checks to pass, fail or not applicable, and will recompute the Implementation Score based on the updated manual checking results. </p>
 <p><strong>Note:</strong> When a manual check is changed to not applicable that element result is removed from the implementation score computation.</p>
