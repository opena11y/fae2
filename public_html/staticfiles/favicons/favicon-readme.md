# Ugh, favicons, icons, tiles, apple touch icons...

The best exploration and [explanation of what icons/favicons you need that I have ever come across](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/touch-icons) is from Mathias Bynens.

Read it for context if desired.

I decided that the icons/favicons I cared to use were:
  - favicon.ico
  - apple-touch-icon.png
  - android-chrome-512x512.png
  - mstile-150x150.png
  - mstile-310x310.png
  - safari-pinned-tab.svg
  - site.webmanifest
  - apple-touch-icon-60x60.png
  - apple-touch-icon-76x76.png
  - browserconfig.xml
  - favicon-16x16.png
  - favicon-32x32.png
  - android-chrome-192x192.png
  - apple-touch-icon-120x120.png
  - apple-touch-icon-152x152.png
  - apple-touch-icon-180x180.png

But even those are overkill and irritating, they just happen to be the sizes readily generated by [Iconifier](https://iconifier.net/), when I wasn't feeling too curmudgeonly about the virtues of open source software.

**Note that the largest is 512 x 512 pixels.**

Thus, you or your designer should design your icons/favicons at at least that size (I think I designed them mine 1000 x 1000px) and them upload them to this directory.

If you're uncertain what you need, default to the first 3 in the list above.

This file is here not only to instruct, but also to allow me to check it into git.
